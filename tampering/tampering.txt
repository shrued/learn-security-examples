The vulnerability observed in the original code, tampering/insecure.js, stems from the lack of input sanitization, allowing malicious scripts to be executed within the application's context. This vulnerability, known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), enables attackers to inject harmful code, leading to various security threats such as session hijacking, data theft, and malware propagation.

To mitigate this risk, the secure version, tampering/secure.js, implements stringent input validation and sanitization procedures. By encoding special characters in user inputs using a dedicated function, the application prevents the execution of injected scripts. This approach ensures that any malicious code is treated as plain text, preserving the integrity of the application's content and functionality.

Furthermore, by adhering to security best practices, such as input validation and output encoding, the secure version upholds the integrity of the application and the data it manages. By addressing vulnerabilities that undermine the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system, the secure version enhances overall security posture and safeguards against unauthorized tampering and data breaches.
